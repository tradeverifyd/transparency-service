[![CI - Interoperability](https://github.com/tradeverifyd/transparency-service/actions/workflows/ci-interop.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tradeverifyd/transparency-service/actions/workflows/ci-interop.yml)

Experimental IETF standards-based transparency service implementing SCITT (Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency, and Trust) using COSE (CBOR Object Signing and Encryption) and RFC 6962 Merkle trees.

Both go and typescript implementations are under development.

The go implementation is the canonical reference for the IETF drafts and RFCs.

The typescript implementation is use to cross test the go implementation.
