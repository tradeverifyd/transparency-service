# Specification Quality Checklist: Cross-Implementation Integration Test Suite

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Specification focuses on cross-implementation compatibility validation without prescribing testing frameworks
- ✅ User stories emphasize developer/auditor value (API compatibility, CLI parity, cryptographic interoperability)
- ✅ Language is accessible - describes "what to test" not "how to implement tests"
- ✅ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are specified
- ✅ All 36 functional requirements are testable with clear success/failure criteria
- ✅ Success criteria include specific metrics (100% compatibility, <30 seconds execution, <5 minutes detection)
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (e.g., "semantically equivalent outputs" not "JSON diffing with jq")
- ✅ 6 user stories each have 5 acceptance scenarios (30 total scenarios defined)
- ✅ 10 edge cases identified covering empty states, concurrency, large payloads, encoding, errors
- ✅ Scope clearly bounded to cross-testing existing implementations (not extending either implementation)
- ✅ Dependencies implicitly identified (requires both implementations to be complete and operational)

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- ✅ Each of 36 functional requirements has clear pass/fail criteria (e.g., "MUST verify", "MUST validate", "MUST confirm")
- ✅ 6 prioritized user stories cover complete testing surface: API compatibility (P1), CLI parity (P1), crypto interop (P2), Merkle proofs (P2), queries (P3), receipts (P3)
- ✅ 12 measurable success criteria define concrete outcomes (percentages, time limits, counts)
- ✅ No testing frameworks, assertion libraries, or implementation languages mentioned in spec

## Notes

**All checklist items PASSED** ✅

The specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`). The spec successfully:

1. **Defines clear value**: Explains why cross-implementation testing matters (vendor lock-in prevention, standards compliance, operational flexibility)
2. **Prioritizes effectively**: P1 items (API/CLI compatibility) are foundational, P2 items (crypto/proofs) are trust-critical, P3 items (queries/receipts) are usability enhancements
3. **Provides comprehensive coverage**: 36 functional requirements span CLI, HTTP APIs, cryptography, Merkle trees, databases, workflows, and error handling
4. **Sets measurable targets**: Success criteria define 100% compatibility thresholds, performance bounds, and automation expectations
5. **Identifies complexity**: Edge cases highlight testing challenges (concurrency, encoding, network failures, key format variations)

**Recommendation**: Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation tasks.

**No clarifications needed** - specification contains sufficient detail for planning phase.
