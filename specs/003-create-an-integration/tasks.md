# Tasks: Cross-Implementation Integration Test Suite

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/003-create-an-integration/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: This feature IS the test suite - no separate tests needed for test infrastructure. Task validation is via execution success.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (P1-P3) to enable independent implementation and testing of each story category.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1-US6)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Test suite located in `tests/interop/` at repository root
- Go 1.24 test orchestration with shell script coordination
- Both Go and TypeScript implementations available as prerequisites

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Test suite initialization and structure needed by all user stories

- [x] T001 Initialize Go module for test suite at tests/interop/go.mod with dependencies: testing, net/http, os/exec
- [x] T002 [P] Create directory structure: tests/interop/{lib,cli,http,crypto,merkle,e2e,scripts,fixtures}
- [x] T003 [P] Create fixture subdirectories: tests/interop/fixtures/{keys,payloads,statements,rfc-vectors}
- [x] T004 [P] Create test README at tests/interop/README.md documenting test suite purpose and running instructions (Note: Existing README preserved, Go test orchestration will complement existing TypeScript tests)
- [x] T005 [P] Create test orchestration entry point at tests/interop/main_test.go with package setup and shared test utilities
- [x] T006 [P] Define test configuration types in tests/interop/lib/types.go (TestExecutionContext, TestResult, ImplementationResult structs with snake_case JSON tags)

---

- [x] T015 [P] Generate RFC 9052 COSE Sign1 test vectors in tests/interop/fixtures/rfc-vectors/cose_sign1.json (various protected headers, CWT claims combinations - Note: Existing go-cose-generator/ produces cose-vectors/*.json)

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 (HTTP API Testing)

```bash
# After Foundational phase completes, run all US1 tests in parallel:
cd tests/interop

# Run HTTP API tests concurrently (different endpoints = no conflicts)
go test -v -parallel 6 ./http/config_test.go &
go test -v -parallel 6 ./http/entries_test.go &
go test -v -parallel 6 ./http/checkpoint_test.go &
go test -v -parallel 6 ./http/health_test.go &
go test -v -parallel 6 ./http/query_test.go &
go test -v -parallel 6 ./http/errors_test.go &
wait

7. Add E2E workflows ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **Complete workflows validated!**
8. Each phase adds validation coverage without breaking previous tests

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase:

## Test Execution Requirements

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Prerequisites: Go 1.24+, Bun latest, both implementations built
cd tests/interop

# Run all tests
go test -v ./...

# Run with parallelism (faster, uses unique ports per test)
go test -v -parallel 10 ./...

# Run specific user story tests
go test -v ./http/...  # User Story 1
go test -v ./cli/...   # User Story 2
go test -v ./crypto/... # User Story 3

# Generate JSON report for CI
go test -json ./... > test-results.json

# Generate Markdown report
go run ./lib/report.go --input test-results.json --output report.md
```

### CI Integration

```bash
# GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: |
    cd tests/interop
    go test -v -parallel 10 -json ./... > results.json
    go run ./lib/report.go --input results.json --output report.md

- name: Upload Test Results
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: integration-test-results
    path: tests/interop/report.md
```

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no shared state - safe to run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Map tasks to user stories for traceability
- **Test orchestration**: Go testing framework provides structure, parallel execution, CI integration
- **Each user story is independently testable**: Enables incremental delivery
- **Foundational phase is critical**: Must complete before any user story tests
- **Clean slate per test**: t.TempDir() ensures deterministic results
- **RFC compliance**: Test vectors from Go tlog ensure validation against specs, not implementations
- **snake_case throughout**: All JSON fields, test data, reports use snake_case per user requirement
- **hex encoding throughout**: All identifiers use lowercase hex per user requirement
- **File paths are exact**: Ready for implementation without additional context
