**Feature**: 002-restructure-this-project
**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Analyst**: SpecKit Analysis Workflow
**Status**: ‚úÖ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

## Executive Summary

Cross-artifact analysis of spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md reveals **high consistency** with minor gaps requiring attention before implementation. The feature is well-defined with clear user stories, comprehensive technical design, and structured task breakdown.

**Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ 24 functional requirements fully covered by 85 implementation tasks
- ‚úÖ Constitution compliance verified across all 8 principles
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 3 minor ambiguities requiring clarification
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 2 missing test coverage areas
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 media type inconsistency between plan and research

**Recommendation**: **PROCEED WITH IMPLEMENTATION** after addressing 6 minor findings below.

---

## Methodology

### Artifacts Analyzed
1. **spec.md** (179 lines): Feature specification with 5 user stories, 24 functional requirements, 10 success criteria
2. **plan.md** (393 lines): Implementation plan with technical context, constitution check, project structure
3. **tasks.md** (1391 lines): 85 implementation tasks organized by user story priority

### Analysis Dimensions
- **Requirement Coverage**: Do tasks implement all functional requirements?
- **Duplication Detection**: Are requirements or tasks unnecessarily repeated?
- **Ambiguity Analysis**: Are specifications underspecified or contradictory?
- **Constitution Alignment**: Do artifacts comply with all 8 principles?
- **Test Coverage**: Are all user stories independently testable?
- **Consistency**: Do artifacts agree on technical details?

---

## Findings

### Category 1: Inconsistencies

#### I-001: Media Type Discrepancy for Receipts ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
**Location**: plan.md:64 vs research.md:100-117
**Artifacts**: plan.md, research.md

**Issue**:
- plan.md specifies: `Receipts: application/cbor`
- research.md specifies: `POST /entries ‚Üí 201 application/cose (receipt)`
- openapi.yaml:108 specifies: `application/cose` for receipt response

**Impact**: Implementation confusion about correct media type for receipts

**Evidence**:
```
plan.md line 64:  - Receipts: `application/cbor`
research.md line 108: Response: 201 application/cose (receipt)
openapi.yaml line 108: content: application/cose
```

**Resolution**: Research.md and openapi.yaml are correct per SCRAPI spec. Update plan.md:64 to `application/cose`.

**Priority**: Medium (affects implementation but clear resolution)

---

#### I-002: Tile Media Type Discrepancy ‚ö†Ô∏è LOW
**Location**: plan.md:65 vs research.md:340
**Artifacts**: plan.md, research.md, openapi.yaml

**Issue**:
- plan.md:65 specifies: `Tile data: application/x-tlog-tile`
- research.md:340 specifies: `application/octet-stream`
- openapi.yaml:343 specifies: `application/octet-stream`

**Impact**: Incorrect media type in plan.md

**Evidence**:
```
plan.md line 65: - Tile data: `application/x-tlog-tile` (C2SP format)
research.md line 340: content: application/octet-stream
openapi.yaml line 343: content: application/octet-stream
```

**Resolution**: Research.md and openapi.yaml are correct per C2SP spec. Update plan.md:65 to `application/octet-stream`.

**Priority**: Low (documentation only, correct in implementation artifacts)

---

### Category 2: Duplications

#### D-001: CLI Command Structure Repeated ‚úÖ JUSTIFIED
**Location**: tasks.md (T017-T024) vs spec.md (FR-003 through FR-006)
**Artifacts**: tasks.md, spec.md

**Issue**: CLI commands for keys, identity, statement appear in both functional requirements and tasks

**Analysis**: This is **justified duplication**:
- FR-003 through FR-006 define **what** must be supported (requirements)
- T017-T024 define **how** to implement them (tasks)
- Proper requirement traceability maintained

**Action**: No change required

---

#### D-002: Interoperability Testing in Multiple Locations ‚úÖ JUSTIFIED
**Location**: spec.md (US2), tasks.md (Phase 4), plan.md (Constitution VIII)
**Artifacts**: All three

**Issue**: Interoperability requirements appear in user story, constitution check, and task breakdown

**Analysis**: This is **justified duplication**:
- Spec.md: User-facing acceptance criteria
- Plan.md: Constitution compliance verification
- Tasks.md: Implementation-level test design
- Each serves different purpose in workflow

**Action**: No change required

---

### Category 3: Ambiguities

#### A-001: "Equivalent" vs "Identical" API Responses üîç HIGH
**Location**: FR-007, SC-004, tasks.md:T057-T060
**Artifacts**: spec.md, tasks.md

**Issue**: Spec uses both "equivalent" and "identical" to describe API response requirements

**Evidence**:
- FR-007: "MUST expose **equivalent** API endpoints"
- SC-004: "**structurally equivalent** responses"
- T058: "Response schemas **identical** to TypeScript"
- T060: "Tile data **byte-identical** to TypeScript"

**Ambiguity**: What is the precise requirement?
- Structurally equivalent (same JSON structure, different whitespace/order)
- Byte-identical (exact byte match)
- Semantically equivalent (same meaning, different encoding)

**Impact**: Affects test strictness and implementation acceptance criteria

**Resolution Required**: Clarify in spec.md:
- SCRAPI endpoints: **Structurally equivalent** (same schema, deterministic CBOR)
- Tile data: **Byte-identical** (exact binary match)
- Checkpoint signatures: **Structurally equivalent** (different signatures, same payload)

**Priority**: High (affects pass/fail criteria for interop tests)

---

#### A-002: Test Vector "Generation from Go" Scope üîç MEDIUM
**Location**: Assumption #2, tasks.md:T028-T039
**Artifacts**: spec.md, tasks.md

**Issue**: Unclear which test vectors are generated from Go and which are cross-validated

**Evidence**:
- Spec Assumption #2: "Test vectors are generated using the Go implementation"
- T028: "Go program to generate interoperability test vectors"
- T029: "Generate ES256 key test vectors (Go)"
- T032: "Generate statement signing test vectors (Go)"
- T040-T043: "Cross-test" tasks that seem to generate artifacts dynamically

**Ambiguity**: Are test vectors:
1. Pre-generated fixtures in `/tests/interop/fixtures/` (static)
2. Dynamically generated during test execution (runtime)
3. Regenerated on every Go change (CI-based)

**Impact**: Affects test reproducibility and CI design

**Resolution Required**: Clarify in plan.md:
- Static test vectors: Generated once, committed to repo
- Dynamic cross-tests: Generate artifacts at runtime for validation
- CI regeneration: When to regenerate vectors (on Go library changes)

**Priority**: Medium (affects CI/CD design)

---

#### A-003: "Parallel Organization Structure" Precision üîç LOW
**Location**: FR-012, plan.md:260-268, tasks.md:T007-T008
**Artifacts**: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md

**Issue**: "Parallel organization patterns" not precisely defined

**Evidence**:
- FR-012: "Directory structures within each implementation MUST follow **parallel organization patterns**"
- Plan.md shows: TypeScript uses `src/lib/`, Go uses `pkg/`
- Plan.md shows: TypeScript uses `src/cli/`, Go uses `internal/cli/`

**Ambiguity**: What level of parallelism is required?
- Directory names identical? (No: `src/` vs `pkg/`)
- Module structure identical? (Unclear)
- File names identical? (Unclear: `keys.ts` vs `keys.go`)

**Impact**: Low - structure is clear in plan.md, but spec could be more precise

**Resolution**: Add clarification to spec.md FR-012:
> Parallel organization means: (1) Same conceptual modules (keys/, identity/, statement/), (2) Similar subdirectory nesting depth, (3) Language-idiomatic naming (src/ for TS, pkg/ for Go)

**Priority**: Low (plan.md provides sufficient guidance)

---

### Category 4: Constitution Alignment

#### CA-001: All Principles Verified ‚úÖ PASS

**Analysis**: Constitution check in plan.md:76-128 thoroughly evaluates all 8 principles:

| Principle | Status | Evidence |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| I: Transparency by Design | ‚úÖ PASS | FR-009, FR-010 mandate test validation |
| II: Verifiable Audit Trails | ‚úÖ PASS | FR-006 (receipts), existing transparency log |
| III: Test-First Development | ‚úÖ PASS | Phase 1 design before Phase 2 tasks |
| IV: API-First Architecture | ‚úÖ PASS | FR-007, FR-019, OpenAPI contract |
| V: Observability | ‚úÖ PASS | Existing features preserved |
| VI: Data Integrity | ‚úÖ PASS | FR-021 (lockstep versioning), FR-013 (interop) |
| VII: Simplicity | ‚ö†Ô∏è JUSTIFIED | Dual-language complexity justified + mitigated |
| VIII: Go as Source of Truth | ‚úÖ PASS | FR-013, FR-020, test vectors from Go |

**Action**: No issues found

---

### Category 5: Coverage Gaps

#### CG-001: Missing Test for FR-015 (Configuration Consistency) ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
**Location**: FR-015, tasks.md
**Artifacts**: spec.md, tasks.md

**Issue**: FR-015 requires "Both implementations MUST support the same configuration file formats and environment variables" but no explicit test task validates this

**Current Coverage**:
- T067: Create server configuration (TypeScript)
- T068: Create server configuration (Go)
- But no cross-implementation configuration test

**Gap**: No test validates:
1. Same config file loads in both implementations
2. Same environment variables work identically
3. Error handling for invalid config is consistent

**Impact**: Configuration divergence could slip through testing

**Resolution**: Add task T086 to tasks.md:
```markdown
### T086: Test configuration compatibility
**Story**: US4
**Description**: Verify configuration files work in both implementations
**Files**:
- `/tests/interop/config-compat.test.ts`

**Steps**:
1. Create config.json with all options
2. Load in TypeScript server
3. Load in Go server
4. Verify parsed values identical

**Acceptance**: Same config file works in both (FR-015)
```

**Priority**: Medium (affects deployment parity)

---

#### CG-002: Missing Performance Test for Merkle Operations ‚ö†Ô∏è LOW
**Location**: plan.md:40-45 (Performance Goals), tasks.md:T071
**Artifacts**: plan.md, tasks.md

**Issue**: Plan.md:45 states "Merkle tree operations must match Go tlog performance characteristics" but T071 only tests API latency

**Current Coverage**:
- T071 tests: Statement registration, receipt generation, tile retrieval, API throughput
- Missing: Direct Merkle tree operation benchmarks

**Gap**: No test validates:
1. Hash computation performance
2. Inclusion proof generation performance
3. Tile generation performance

**Impact**: Low - API tests indirectly cover this, but not isolated

**Resolution**: Add subtask to T071:
```markdown
**Additional Tests**:
- Merkle hash computation <10ms for 10,000 leaves
- Inclusion proof generation <50ms
- Tile generation <100ms for full tile (256 hashes)
```

**Priority**: Low (covered indirectly by T071)

---

### Category 6: Underspecified Areas

#### US-001: Error Response Format Not Fully Specified üîç MEDIUM
**Location**: FR-016, research.md:336-357, openapi.yaml
**Artifacts**: spec.md, research.md, openapi.yaml

**Issue**: FR-016 requires "Error messages and status codes MUST be consistent across implementations" but error response format not fully specified

**Current Specification**:
- research.md:336-357 shows RFC 7807 Problem Details (CBOR format)
- openapi.yaml:598-622 defines ProblemDetails schema
- But no specification for:
  - CLI error format (stdout vs stderr)
  - Error code conventions
  - Stack traces (include or exclude?)

**Impact**: Medium - affects FR-016 and SC-003 validation

**Resolution**: Add to data-model.md:
```markdown
## Error Response Formats

### API Errors (RFC 7807)
Media Type: `application/concise-problem-details+cbor`
[existing schema]

### CLI Errors
Format: `Error: <message>\nDetails: <details>\nSee: <doc-url>`
Exit codes: 1 (general), 2 (usage), 3 (auth), 4 (network)
Stack traces: Only with --debug flag

### Library Errors
TypeScript: Throw Error with cause chain
Go: Return error with wrapped context
```

**Priority**: Medium (affects implementation consistency)

---

#### US-002: Migration Communication Strategy Removed ‚ö†Ô∏è LOW
**Location**: research.md (Section 11 removed per user feedback)
**Artifacts**: research.md

**Issue**: User feedback stated "There is no need to manage communication, this project is experimental, there have been no releases" which resulted in removal of migration communication section

**Observation**: While current status is experimental, spec.md:22 (FR-022) states "Existing TypeScript code MUST be directly moved to scitt-typescript/ with updated import paths"

**Potential Gap**: When the project moves from experimental to released, what is the communication plan?

**Impact**: Low - correctly scoped for current experimental status, but may need revisiting

**Resolution**: Add note to plan.md:
```markdown
**Note**: Project is currently experimental with no prior releases. Migration communication strategy will be developed before first production release (post-1.0.0).
```

**Priority**: Low (correctly scoped for now)
