**Feature**: 002-restructure-this-project
**Specification Version**: Draft (2025-10-12)
**Validation Date**: 2025-10-12

## Completeness Criteria

- [x] **User Scenarios Present**: 5 user stories documented with clear priorities (P1, P2, P3)
- [x] **Priority Justification**: Each user story includes "Why this priority" rationale
- [x] **Independent Test Criteria**: Each user story has explicit "Independent Test" section
- [x] **Acceptance Scenarios**: All user stories have Given-When-Then acceptance criteria
- [x] **Edge Cases Documented**: 6 edge cases identified covering version mismatches, mixed artifacts, navigation, breaking changes, divergence, and documentation drift
- [x] **Functional Requirements**: 20 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-020) covering all aspects
- [x] **Key Entities Defined**: 7 key entities documented (Language Implementation, Cryptographic Key, Issuer Identity, Statement, Signed Statement, Receipt, Cross-Implementation Test, Interoperability Artifact)
- [x] **Success Criteria**: 10 measurable success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010)
- [x] **Assumptions Listed**: 10 assumptions documented including Go as canonical reference, test vector source, version sync, documentation duplication, etc.

## Quality Criteria

- [x] **Technology-Agnostic**: Success criteria focus on outcomes, not implementation details
- [x] **Measurable Outcomes**: All success criteria are quantifiable (5 minutes, 100% pass rate, identical structure, etc.)
- [x] **Testable Requirements**: Each functional requirement maps to verifiable tests
- [x] **Constitution Alignment**: Explicitly references Principle VIII (Go Interoperability), Principle III (Test-First), API-First, and other constitutional principles
- [x] **No Ambiguity**: All requirements use clear MUST/SHOULD language following RFC 2119 conventions
- [x] **Interoperability Focus**: Cross-implementation testing is central theme (FR-009, FR-010, FR-013, FR-020)

## Specification Validation

### User Scenarios Assessment

| User Story | Priority | Test Independence | Acceptance Criteria | Constitutional Alignment |
|------------|----------|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Language-Independent Quick Start | P1 | ✓ Clear | 3 scenarios | Simplicity (VII) |
| Cross-Implementation Interoperability | P1 | ✓ Clear | 4 scenarios | Go Interop (VIII) |
| Consistent CLI Operations | P2 | ✓ Clear | 4 scenarios | Maintainability (VII) |
| Server Deployment Parity | P2 | ✓ Clear | 4 scenarios | API-First (IV), Observability (V) |
| Library Integration | P3 | ✓ Clear | 3 scenarios | API-First (IV) |

**Total Acceptance Scenarios**: 18 (sufficient coverage for 5 user stories)

### Requirements Coverage Analysis

**Core Functionality** (FR-001 to FR-008): ✓ Complete
- Dual directory structure
- Library, CLI, server components
- Key generation, issuer identity, statements, receipts

**Testing & Interoperability** (FR-009 to FR-010, FR-013, FR-020): ✓ Complete
- Cross-implementation test suite
- 100% interoperability compliance
- Artifact exchange validation

**User Experience** (FR-011, FR-014, FR-016): ✓ Complete
- Documentation parallel paths
- Consistent CLI help
- Consistent error messages

**Technical Consistency** (FR-012, FR-015, FR-017 to FR-019): ✓ Complete
- Parallel directory structures
- Configuration format parity
- Performance targets
- IETF standards compliance
- .well-known endpoint consistency

### Missing or Unclear Elements

**Status**: ✓ NONE - All mandatory sections are complete and clear

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present in specification
- All requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- Edge cases identified with sufficient detail for risk mitigation planning
- Assumptions are explicit and reasonable

## Constitution Compliance Check

| Principle | Addressed in Spec | Evidence |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| I. Transparency by Design | ✓ Yes | FR-011 (documentation clarity), SC-005 (parallel documentation paths) |
| II. Verifiable Audit Trails | ✓ Implicit | Transparency log operations preserved in both implementations |
| III. Test-First Development | ✓ Yes | FR-009, FR-010 (cross-implementation test suite), all user stories have "Independent Test" criteria |
| IV. API-First Architecture | ✓ Yes | FR-007 (SCRAPI endpoints), FR-008 (library interfaces), User Story 4 (Server Parity) |
| V. Observability and Monitoring | ✓ Implicit | Server implementations will maintain existing observability features |
| VI. Data Integrity and Versioning | ✓ Yes | Assumption #3 (version synchronization), FR-018 (IETF standards) |
| VII. Simplicity and Maintainability | ✓ Yes | FR-012 (parallel structures), FR-014 (consistent CLI), SC-010 (navigability without docs) |
| VIII. Go Interoperability as Source of Truth | ✓ **YES** | **FR-013 (100% interoperability), FR-010 (artifact exchange), Assumption #2 (Go test vectors), User Story 2 (P1 priority)** |

**Constitutional Compliance**: ✓ PASS

All principles are addressed either explicitly or implicitly. Principle VIII (Go Interoperability) is central to the entire feature and explicitly referenced in multiple requirements.

## Readiness Assessment

### Ready for Next Phase: ✓ YES

**Justification**:
1. All mandatory specification sections are complete
2. No clarification needed - spec includes informed defaults and explicit assumptions
3. Constitutional compliance verified (especially critical Principle VIII)
4. User stories prioritized with clear test criteria
5. Functional requirements comprehensive and testable
6. Success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic
7. Edge cases identified for risk planning

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Option A - Proceed Directly to Planning**: Run `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
   - Recommended if stakeholders agree with assumptions and priorities
   - Fastest path to implementation

2. **Option B - Clarification Phase**: Run `/speckit.clarify` to explore underspecified areas
   - Recommended if team wants to validate assumptions before detailed planning
   - Will generate targeted questions about approach choices

### Notes for Planning Phase

When proceeding to `/speckit.plan`:
- Consider Assumption #1 carefully: "Go Implementation Standards" - TypeScript conforms to Go
- Assumption #4: Documentation duplication strategy (not DRY) - intentional for user independence
- FR-020: Cross-implementation test failures block both implementations - requires careful CI/CD design
- Edge case about version mismatches (item 2) should inform versioning strategy in plan
