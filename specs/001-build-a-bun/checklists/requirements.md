# Specification Quality Checklist: IETF Standards-Based Transparency Service

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Summary**:
- 4 user stories (P1-P4) covering deploy, register, verify, audit workflows
- 40 functional requirements with clear testable criteria
- 11 measurable success criteria aligned with user stories
- 10 edge cases identified
- 11 assumptions documented for scope boundaries
- No clarifications needed - all requirements specified with reasonable defaults

**Ready for**: `/speckit.plan` - proceed to implementation planning phase

## Notes

- All checklist items completed successfully
- Specification is ready for technical planning without further clarification needed
