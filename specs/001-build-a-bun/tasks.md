# Tasks: IETF Standards-Based Transparency Service

**Input**: Design documents from `specs/001-build-a-bun/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Test-First Development (TDD) is **MANDATORY** per project constitution. Tests MUST be written before implementation, verified to fail, then implemented to pass (Red-Green-Refactor).

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (P1-P4) to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Bun + TypeScript with native SQLite and built-in test runner

---

---

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion (can run parallel with US1 if staffed)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational + US2 (needs registration to test verification)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational + US2 (needs registered statements to audit)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **US2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - Depends on US1 for running service (but can be tested with mock)
- **US3 (P3)**: Depends on US2 for registered statements to verify
- **US4 (P4)**: Depends on US2 for registered statements to audit

### Within Each User Story (TDD Order)

1. **Tests written FIRST** (must fail before implementation)
2. **Implementation to pass tests**
3. **Refactor** if needed
4. **Story complete** before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1: Setup**
- All tasks (T001-T006) can run sequentially but are quick

**Phase 2: Foundational**
- Storage implementations (T009-T014): All [P] after interface tests
- Database implementations (T017-T022): All [P] after schema
- COSE tests can run parallel with implementations once tests pass

**Phase 3: User Story 1**
- Tests (T035-T037): All [P] (different contracts)
- CLI utilities (T040-T041): Both [P]
- Service routes (T043-T045): All [P]

**Phase 4: User Story 2**
- Tests (T049-T051): All [P]
- SCRAPI types + validation (T056-T057): Both [P]

**Phase 5: User Story 3**
- Tests (T062-T063): Both [P]
- Service endpoints (T066-T068): All [P]

**Phase 7: Polish**
- Documentation tasks (T078-T081): All [P]

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# After Foundational phase completes, launch all US1 tests together:
bun test tests/contract/config.test.ts &
bun test tests/contract/service-keys.test.ts &
bun test tests/contract/health.test.ts &
wait

# Verify tests FAIL (Red phase of TDD)

# Then implement CLI utilities in parallel:
# T040: src/cli/utils/config.ts
# T041: src/cli/utils/output.ts

# Then implement service routes in parallel:
# T043: src/service/routes/config.ts (configuration)
# T044: src/service/routes/config.ts (keys)
# T045: src/service/routes/health.ts
# T046: src/service/middleware/logging.ts
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test US1 independently (deploy service, verify health)
5. Deploy/demo basic transparency service

### Incremental Delivery

1. Foundation (Setup + Foundational) ‚Üí Ready for user stories
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **MVP deployed!**
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Issuers can register statements
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Verifiers can verify statements
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Auditors can audit log
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers after Foundational phase:
- **Developer A**: User Story 1 (service deployment)
- **Developer B**: User Story 2 (statement registration)
- **Developer C**: Storage abstraction + COSE porting (Foundational work)

Once Foundational completes, US1 and US2 can proceed in parallel.

---

## Test-First Development (TDD) Compliance

**Constitution Requirement**: Tests MUST be written before implementation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### TDD Workflow for Each Task

1. **Write Test**: Create test file, write test cases based on acceptance criteria
2. **Run Test**: Execute test, verify it FAILS (Red phase)
3. **Implement**: Write minimum code to make test pass
4. **Run Test**: Execute test, verify it PASSES (Green phase)
5. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green
6. **Commit**: Commit passing test + implementation together

### Test Coverage Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: All lib/ components (COSE, Merkle, storage, database)
- **Contract Tests**: All SCRAPI endpoints (compliance with OpenAPI spec)
- **Integration Tests**: Each user story workflow end-to-end
- **Performance Tests**: Success criteria validation (SC-002, SC-003, SC-008)

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test

# Run specific test file
bun test tests/unit/cose/sign.test.ts

# Run tests for a user story
bun test tests/integration/issuer-workflow.test.ts

# Run contract tests (SCRAPI compliance)
bun test tests/contract/
```

---

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies - can run in parallel
- **[Story] labels**: Map tasks to user stories for traceability
- **TDD order**: Tests always before implementation (enforced by constitution)
- **Each user story is independently testable**: Can deliver incrementally
- **Foundational phase is critical**: Must complete before any user story
- **Stop at any checkpoint**: Validate story independently before continuing
- **Commit after each Green phase**: Passing test + implementation together
- **File paths are exact**: Ready for LLM execution without additional context

---

## Task Summary

**Total Tasks**: 96
- **Setup**: 6 tasks
- **Foundational**: 40 tasks (BLOCKING) - includes 17 sanity test tasks for COSE + Merkle tree components
- **User Story 1**: 14 tasks (tests: 4, implementation: 10)
- **User Story 2**: 13 tasks (tests: 4, implementation: 9)
- **User Story 3**: 10 tasks (tests: 4, implementation: 6)
- **User Story 4**: 6 tasks (tests: 2, implementation: 4)
- **Polish**: 7 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**: 32 tasks marked [P]

**Independent Test Points**: 4 (one per user story)

**Suggested MVP Scope**: Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 (User Story 1 only) = 60 tasks

**Test-First Ratio**: 26 test tasks : 70 implementation tasks (1:2.7 ratio, TDD enforced with bottom-up sanity tests)
