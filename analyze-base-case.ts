// Let me understand what happens when n == hi

// Base case 1: n == hi && lo == 0
// - This means we've reached the exact old tree size
// - The proof should be empty
// - Return (old, old) - both old and new trees are the same

// Base case 2: n == hi && lo != 0  
// - This means we've reached a subtree that matches the old tree boundary
// - The proof should have exactly 1 element
// - Return (p[0], p[0]) - this is the hash of this subtree

// So for oldSize=3, newSize=4:
// Call 1: runTreeProof(p=[h3], lo=0, hi=4, n=3)
//   k=2, n=3 > lo+k=2, go RIGHT
//   Call runTreeProof(p=[], lo=2, hi=4, n=3)
//     Now n==3, hi==4, n < hi, so NOT base case
//     But wait... shouldn't this be n <= hi+1 or something?

// Actually, let me think about what lo, hi, n mean:
// - [lo, hi) is the range of the NEW tree we're considering
// - n is the size of the OLD tree
// - We're trying to verify that tree[0,n) is consistent with tree[0,hi)

// For the second call with lo=2, hi=4, n=3:
// - We're looking at NEW tree range [2,4)
// - OLD tree size is 3, so old tree is [0,3)
// - Within this subtree [2,4), how much of it is "old"?
// - The old tree [0,3) overlaps with [2,4) at [2,3)
// - So within this subtree, the "old size" is effectively 3, and "new size" is 4

// But the recursion formula n <= lo+k checks if 3 <= 2+k
// With lo=2, hi=4, k = largestPowerOfTwo(4-2) = 1
// So: 3 <= 2+1 = 3 <= 3 = TRUE!

console.log("AH! I found the bug!");
console.log("");
console.log("Call 2: runTreeProof(p=[], lo=2, hi=4, n=3)");
console.log("  k = largestPowerOfTwoLessThan(4-2) = largestPowerOfTwoLessThan(2) = 1");
console.log("  n <= lo+k? → 3 <= 2+1? → 3 <= 3? → TRUE!");
console.log("");
console.log("So it should go LEFT, not fail!");
console.log("Let's trace with k=1:");
console.log("  Call 3: runTreeProof(p=[], lo=2, hi=2+1=3, n=3)");
console.log("    Now n=3, hi=3, so n == hi!");
console.log("    lo != 0 (lo=2), so this is base case 2");
console.log("    But p should have length 1, and we have length 0!");
console.log("");
console.log("So the issue is that in Call 1, when we go RIGHT,");
console.log("we do runTreeProof(p[:len(p)-1], ...) which gives us p=[]");
console.log("But then in Call 2, we should go LEFT, not RIGHT");
console.log("And when we go LEFT in Call 2, we need 1 proof element");
console.log("");
console.log("This means Call 1 is wrong. Let me re-check the k calculation.");
