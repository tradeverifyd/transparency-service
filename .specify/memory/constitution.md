# Transparency Service Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Transparency by Design

Every feature MUST provide full visibility into its operations and decisions. This includes:

- All data transformations MUST be traceable and explainable
- System decisions MUST include rationale and supporting evidence
- API responses MUST include metadata about data provenance
- Operations MUST log sufficient detail for complete reconstruction
- No hidden or undocumented behavior permitted

**Rationale**: As a transparency service, our core mission demands that we practice what we preach. Users trust us to provide transparency; we must be transparent in how we deliver that transparency.

### II. Verifiable Audit Trails

All state changes and significant operations MUST create immutable, verifiable audit records:

- Every data modification MUST record: timestamp, actor, operation, before/after states
- Audit logs MUST be tamper-evident (cryptographic signatures or hashes)
- Audit trails MUST be queryable and exportable
- Retention policies MUST be documented and enforced
- Audit records MUST survive system failures

**Rationale**: Transparency without verifiability is just theater. Users must be able to independently verify claims made by the system.

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is mandatory for all production code:

- Tests MUST be written before implementation
- Tests MUST fail before implementation begins
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced
- User/stakeholder approval of test scenarios required before implementation
- No untested code in production

**Rationale**: For a transparency service, correctness is not negotiable. TDD ensures we build what is specified, specification is testable, and behavior is verified.

### IV. API-First Architecture

Every feature MUST be exposed through well-defined, versioned APIs:

- OpenAPI/Swagger specifications MUST precede implementation
- All functionality MUST be accessible programmatically
- Human interfaces (CLI, Web UI) are clients of the API, not special cases
- APIs MUST follow RESTful principles or document deviations
- Breaking changes MUST follow deprecation policy (minimum 2 minor versions notice)

**Rationale**: API-first design ensures interoperability, testability, and enables ecosystem growth. It prevents UI-driven design that locks functionality away from programmatic access.

### V. Observability and Monitoring

All services MUST be fully observable in production:

- Structured logging (JSON) with correlation IDs for distributed tracing
- Metrics exposed in Prometheus format (or equivalent)
- Health checks MUST report component-level status
- Performance SLIs (Service Level Indicators) MUST be defined and tracked
- Alerts MUST be actionable and include runbook links

**Rationale**: Transparency services must maintain high availability and performance. Observability enables rapid diagnosis and builds user confidence.

### VI. Data Integrity and Versioning

Data integrity MUST be guaranteed through explicit versioning and validation:

- All data schemas MUST be versioned (semantic versioning)
- Schema migrations MUST be reversible and tested
- Data validation MUST occur at system boundaries
- Checksums/hashes MUST be used to detect corruption
- Backward compatibility MUST be maintained for N-1 versions

**Rationale**: Users depend on data integrity for transparency claims. Version management prevents breaking changes and enables smooth evolution.

### VII. Simplicity and Maintainability

Favor simple, understandable solutions over clever complexity:

- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Build only what is specified
- Prefer standard libraries and established patterns over custom solutions
- Code MUST be self-documenting; comments explain "why", not "what"
- Dependencies MUST be justified (security, maintenance, bundle size)
- Complexity MUST be explicitly justified in implementation plans

**Rationale**: Transparency requires trust. Trust is undermined by systems too complex to understand, audit, or maintain. Simplicity is a security and reliability feature.

## Security and Compliance

### Security Requirements

- Authentication MUST use industry-standard protocols (OAuth2, OIDC, or equivalent)
- Authorization MUST follow principle of least privilege
- Secrets MUST never be committed to version control
- Dependencies MUST be scanned for vulnerabilities (automated in CI/CD)
- Security issues MUST be addressed within SLA: Critical (24h), High (7d), Medium (30d)

### Data Protection

- Personal data MUST comply with applicable regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Data retention policies MUST be documented and enforced
- Data deletion requests MUST be honored within regulatory timeframes
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.3+) and at rest MUST be used for sensitive data

### Compliance

- All changes MUST be tracked in version control with descriptive commit messages
- Production deployments MUST be documented and tagged in git
- Access to production systems MUST be logged and reviewed quarterly
- Incident response procedures MUST be documented and tested annually

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development

1. **Specification**: Features begin with user stories and acceptance criteria (spec.md)
2. **Planning**: Technical approach, dependencies, and structure documented (plan.md)
3. **Constitution Check**: Verify compliance with all principles before implementation
4. **Test Writing**: Tests written and approved, verify they fail
5. **Implementation**: Code written to pass tests (tasks.md)
6. **Validation**: All tests pass, integration verified
7. **Documentation**: User-facing and technical documentation complete
8. **Review**: Code review verifies principle compliance and quality
9. **Deployment**: Staged rollout with monitoring

### Quality Gates

Before merging to main branch:

- All tests MUST pass (unit, integration, contract)
- Code coverage MUST meet minimum threshold (80% for critical paths)
- Security scan MUST show no critical/high vulnerabilities
- Principle compliance MUST be verified (Constitution Check in plan.md)
- Documentation MUST be complete and accurate
- Performance requirements MUST be met (as defined in plan.md)

### Code Review Requirements

- All code MUST be reviewed by at least one other developer
- Reviewers MUST verify principle compliance
- Security-sensitive changes MUST be reviewed by security team
- Breaking changes MUST be reviewed by architecture team
- Review comments MUST be addressed or justified before merge

## Governance

### Amendment Process

This constitution can be amended through the following process:

1. Proposed changes MUST be documented with rationale
2. Impact analysis MUST identify affected templates and workflows
3. Team discussion and approval required (consensus or vote)
4. Version MUST be incremented according to semantic versioning
5. All dependent artifacts MUST be updated for consistency
6. Migration plan MUST be provided for breaking changes
7. Amendment MUST be communicated to all stakeholders

### Versioning Policy

Constitution versions follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

- **MAJOR**: Backward-incompatible changes (principle removal/redefinition)
- **MINOR**: New principles added or material expansions to guidance
- **PATCH**: Clarifications, wording improvements, non-semantic fixes

### Compliance Review

- All feature specifications MUST include Constitution Check section
- Implementation plans MUST document any complexity requiring justification
- Quarterly reviews MUST assess compliance across active projects
- Violations MUST be documented with remediation plans
- Constitution itself MUST be reviewed annually for relevance

### Enforcement

- Constitution supersedes all other development practices and conventions
- Project leads are responsible for ensuring compliance
- Violations discovered in code review MUST be corrected before merge
- Violations discovered post-merge MUST be tracked and remediated
- Repeated violations MUST trigger process review and training

### Guidance for AI Agents

When AI agents (including Claude) work on this project:

- MUST read and comply with this constitution before starting any feature work
- MUST reference constitution principles when making design decisions
- MUST flag any conflicts between user requests and constitutional principles
- MUST include Constitution Check in all implementation plans
- MUST justify any complexity introduced with reference to principles
